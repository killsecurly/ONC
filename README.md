### Notes<br/>
__Turn on when Securly Classroom is Off__<br/>
If you start ONC with Securly Classroom on, the device will never get the signal to turn Classroom off, which causes the flitering to stay active forever.<br/>

## Past Bugs<br/>
Currently, the ONC network config blocks these SSO (Single-Sign-On) Applications:<br/>
Clever, CPM Educational Program, Writable<br/>
Turn off by using `revive.onc` when you have to turn on SSO.<br/>
